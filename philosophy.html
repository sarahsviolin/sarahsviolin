                    "Everyone starts violin for different reasons. Everyone's journey is different. I started playing violin because
                    I didn't want to be like my older sister who played piano at the time. My journey with violin has been a roller coaster. 
                    There were times when I wanted to quit, throw my violin away, but there were also moments that I cherish the most. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    During my years of teaching, I've come to understand every child has a different approach to learning. My goal is to make my lessons interactive,
                    fun, and engaging, so that one day, maybe they will be thanking themselves for pushing through the hard times. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    I emphasize holistic training. I personally started on the Suzuki method, and eventually switched over to the Galamian method of violin training. 
                    As a teacher, I focus on good sound and warmth, without which, we can never hear our mistakes or progress in our technical skills. I find the right mix of teaching
                    by demonstration and letting the student find their own path. A good musician has control, but also has flexibility. It's always about finding your own balance.
